The order is not ordered in anyways. The order came from rihren's high tables desired order and then added some characters by the ancestral language as far as he knows. The Order consists of three groups `original southerner` <sup><sub>Only people of Epor agrees north is the south</sub></sup>, `high table family`, `ancestral characters`.

The characters is been written by top to bottom, then right to left. The characters can also be written right to left, then top to bottom but characters aren't rotated. The w:h ratio is usually max=7:5, min=6:2.
