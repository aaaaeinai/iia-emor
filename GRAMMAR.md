# Grammar

## Rules

1. Conjunction
2. Unordered Conjunction
3. Ordered Conjunction
4. Unordered Conjunction

#### Conjunction

There are two kinds of conjunction in iia'emor. Ordered and Unordered.
Conjunctions are the basic structure in iia'emor 
Conjunctions are treated as a particle and 
Ordered may not just be preceded, it may also denote that the position is taken already.

Ex in english.
Unordered; `boy and girl`, `1 and 2`, `this then that`, `here then there`, `i came and pee`
Ordered; `boy but girl`, `one of two`, `cake in a bag`

Note:
 - 1 particle
 - 2 context
 - 3 supporting context
 - `1 2 3` clause
 - `2 3` content
 - context can either be a content or another clause



#### Unordered Conjunction

Unordered are conjunction connectors like in english `or`, `and` that doesn't have precedence.
Unordered can interchange the context between them


#### Intent vs Specific

This pattern identifies clauses to be either identity or specific by its precedence levels.
If the clause specifies intent, it means that the main context precedes before the supporting context or its adjective have preposition then precedes before the supporting context.
This ensures that the 

Ex: `1 2 3` vs `1 3 2`


#### Intent

| original             | transform              | english
|:-                    |:-                      |:-
| `a cake bag`         | `the bag cake`         | `a cake bag`
| `a heavy bag of cake`| `the bag of cake heavy`| `a cake bag`


#### Intent vs Redact


#### Intent



```
    a {b c d}
```

Note:
- Every character is a context
- Every header2 is an alignment
- `a` main verb/state
- `b` agent
- `c` patient
- `d` benefactee/ locative
- Every character is ordered by default
- Any in between `{` `}` is unordered
- subject is denoted underscore


## Ergative like?

```
    x, y
```

This pattern refers to the origin, agent, or cause in the sentence.
This pattern prioritize or look the reference first to distinguish two context in the sentence

1. If the pattern look like `x`, it means that `x` is the agent given that the `x` contains `-g-` between the first syllable?(so to speak) and the next.
1. If the pattern look like `y`, it means that `y` is the main verb.
1. If the pattern look like `x`, it means that `x` is an interjection.
1. If the pattern look like `x, y`, it means that `x` is the agent and `y` is the main verb given that the `x` contains `-g-` between the first syllable and the next.
1. If the pattern look like `y x`, it means that `x` is the agent and `y` is the main verb with-out any condition (unmarked).
1. If the pattern look like `x, y`, it means that `x` is the agent(genitive) and `y` is its property given that the `x` contains `-g-` between the first syllable and the next.

## Mostly Philippine-type
```
    a(,) b(,) c(,)
```

This pattern pertains to its availability of the context or suffice the contexts
This pattern respect the order of the context to define the meaning.
This pattern relies on thematic relation

1. If the pattern look like `a(,) b`, it means that `a` is the main aspect as the verb and `b` is the agent and is most same as `x`.
1. If the pattern look like `a(,) c`, it means that `a` is the main aspect as the verb and `c` is the patient.

note:
- `(,)` means marked cases are optional depending on either the aspect (irregular verbs)
- everything seems transitive (I pooped (at) toilet bowl, I digest food)
- aspect acting as verbs are always the precedent
- anything after the verb are optional to exist
- place, time, and manner are always considered part of patient if not the agent (I ate (at) home: *the "at home" is a locative patient trigger).
