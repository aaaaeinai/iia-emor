```

This pattern pertains to its availability of the context or suffice the contexts
This pattern respect the order of the context to define the meaning.
This pattern relies on thematic relation

1. If the pattern look like `a(,) b`, it means that `a` is the main aspect as the verb and `b` is the agent and is most same as `x`.
1. If the pattern look like `a(,) c`, it means that `a` is the main aspect as the verb and `c` is the patient.

note:
- `(,)` means marked cases are optional depending on either the aspect (irregular verbs)
- everything seems transitive (I pooped (at) toilet bowl, I digest food)
- aspect acting as verbs are always the precedent
- anything after the verb are optional to exist
- place, time, and manner are always considered part of patient if not the agent (I ate (at) home: *the "at home" is a locative patient trigger).
