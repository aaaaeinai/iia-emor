note:
- (,) means marked cases are optional depending on either the aspect (irregular verbs)
- everything seems transitive (I pooped (at) toilet bowl, I digest food)
- aspect acting as verbs are always the precedent
- anything after the verb are optional to exist
- place, time, and manner are always considered part of patient if not the agent (I ate (at) home: *the "at home" is a locative patient trigger).
